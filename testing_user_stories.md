# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- **I want to easily understand the main areas of research of the group and learn more about it.**

  - Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a hero image with a cover text (the main points are made immediately with the hero image).

  - The text below than briefly describes the main concepts (this is also supported with a schematic image and video where one of the PhD students of the group describes his research project).

- **I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.**

  - At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

- **I want to look for a publication list with DOI links provided.**

  - Each article has a DOI link that brings to the journal website with the publication. This significantly reduces the user's search time.

- **I want to look for the currently available Master students assignments.**

  - A clearly labelled *Come join us* page is easy to find in the navigation bar on every page.
  - Upon entering the *Come join us* page, a Master student will see a hero image illustrating a work in the laboratory. This should immediately create a right impression of an experimental research in the group rather than theoretical one.
  - A Master student can find the list of available thesis projects after the hero image.

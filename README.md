## User Experience (UX)
***

- ### User stories

- ### Design

  - **Colour Scheme**

     The three main colours used are dark grey (#494949), light grey (#f8f9fa) and white.

  - **Typography**

    The Roboto (main text body) and Raleway (headings) fonts are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto and Raleway are clean fonts used frequently in programming, so they are both attractive and appropriate.

  - **Imagery**
     
     Imagery is important. The large, background header images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

   Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
    
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
    
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
    
5. The page will automatically refresh.
    
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
    
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.

3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/).
    
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
    
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
    
4. Open Git Bash
    
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
    
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    ```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
   > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
